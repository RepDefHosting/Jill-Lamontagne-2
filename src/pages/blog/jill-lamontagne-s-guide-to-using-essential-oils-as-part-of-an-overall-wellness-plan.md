[Jill Lamontagne](https://jill-lamontagne.com/), BS (Health Sciences) & MSEd (Special Education Law), is a Kennebunk‑based community catalyst and well‑being strategist who blends evidence‑backed health education with hands‑on mindfulness coaching. By day she directs Waypoint’s adult‑services program—auditing health records, shaping person‑centered budgets, and championing holistic care—while evenings find her leading yoga flows that integrate breathwork with the therapeutic use of essential oils. Jill’s volunteer work with United Way and local conservation groups further underscores her commitment to whole‑person wellness, making her a trusted voice on how plant‑powered remedies can complement balanced living.

Essential oils have been used for centuries to support health and well-being, and they remain popular today as part of a balanced approach to self-care. These concentrated plant extracts are valued for their natural aromas and potential therapeutic properties, offering a way to enhance both physical and emotional wellness when used thoughtfully and safely.

Incorporating essential oils into daily routines can complement other healthy habits like balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and stress management. One of the most common uses for essential oils is aromatherapy. Diffusing oils such as lavender, peppermint, eucalyptus, or bergamot can create a calming or uplifting atmosphere, depending on the scent.

The sense of smell is directly linked to areas of the brain that influence mood, memory, and emotions, which is why certain scents may trigger feelings of relaxation or alertness. For example, lavender is often associated with calming effects and may help promote better sleep, while citrus oils are commonly linked to improved focus and an elevated mood.

Beyond their aromatic appeal, essential oils can also be part of physical wellness practices. When properly diluted, many oils are used topically to support skin health or ease muscle tension. Tea tree oil, for instance, has properties that make it a popular choice for managing minor skin irritations. Eucalyptus and peppermint are often applied to the chest or temples to provide a soothing sensation during seasonal illnesses or to ease tension headaches. However, it’s important to dilute essential oils with a carrier oil, like coconut or jojoba, before applying them to the skin to reduce the chance of irritation or allergic reactions.

Some people also integrate essential oils into their self-care rituals to help manage stress and anxiety. Adding a few drops of oil to a bath, using them in massage, or simply inhaling them during deep breathing exercises can offer moments of mindfulness and relaxation. Creating this kind of sensory pause throughout the day can make a meaningful difference in managing emotional balance, especially when paired with other calming practices like stretching, meditation, or journaling. While essential oils are not a substitute for medical treatment, they can be a helpful tool for managing everyday stress and creating a sense of calm during busy or challenging times.

It’s also worth noting that essential oils are sometimes used to support household wellness. Their natural properties make them a popular ingredient in homemade cleaning products or air fresheners, offering an alternative to synthetic fragrances. Lemon, tea tree, and lavender oils, in particular, are frequently chosen for their pleasant scents and surface-cleaning qualities. Some people also enjoy using essential oils in laundry or linen sprays as a simple way to add freshness to their environment.

While essential oils can be a valuable addition to a wellness plan, safe usage is essential. Not all oils are suitable for all people, and some may interact with medications or cause sensitivity, especially in children, pregnant individuals, or pets. A little research and guidance from a trusted source can help ensure that essential oils are used in a way that supports overall well-being rather than posing unnecessary risks.

When combined with other wellness practices like exercise, balanced eating, quality sleep, and emotional self-care, essential oils can offer an added layer of support for living a more balanced and health-conscious life.
