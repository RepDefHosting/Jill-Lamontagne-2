According to volunteer logistics website Volgistics, roughly 63 million Americans volunteer regularly, or nearly one in four adults. The benefits of volunteering time, money, and resources to philanthropic organizations are many. Individuals enjoy physical and psychological boosts after volunteering and can claim tax breaks based on their volunteer time and donations, to say nothing of the altruistic merit of helping those in need and strengthening the greater community. Individuals interested in volunteering in their community may consider several areas of need.



To begin, America's animal shelters are overcrowded and understaffed. In 2023, 6.5 million cats and dogs were taken in by shelters, up from 5.5 million in 2020. Unfortunately, adoptions are not keeping pace, at just over 6 million, resulting in a net gain of more than 500,000 animals.



Individuals should contact a local shelter and inquire about their volunteer needs, but they can expect a few areas of import. Many shelters require administrative assistance or help cleaning offices and animal spaces. Individuals who enjoy working with animals can walk dogs and play with the pets. If a person cannot commit time to the shelter, they can help raise awareness by sharing posts on social media and promoting the shelter throughout the community.



America's soup kitchens greatly benefit from volunteers. A soup kitchen is an umbrella term for facilities that serve food to unhoused and underprivileged individuals and families. Soup kitchens may or may not provide overnight or long-term shelter, or coordinate with facilities that provide those services. The United States is home to over 61,000 soup kitchens, as well as hundreds of food pantries and food banks. These locations provide free meals and food to upwards of 46 million Americans each year.



Tens of millions of Americans donate to or volunteer with local soup kitchens. Food donations are critical to soup kitchen operations, though individuals should communicate with the kitchen first so that they can comply with any regulations. As for volunteer work, kitchens always benefit from experienced cooks and chefs. They also rely on volunteers to serve and help situate guests and to help set up and clean up each day. Individuals who cannot spend time at a nearby kitchen can volunteer by designing flyers and otherwise promoting the organization.



Individuals concerned about the health and integrity of their local environment can volunteer with a local branch of The Nature Conservancy or a similar organization, such as Keep America Beautiful. For those compelled to make the most impact locally, it can be helpful to discuss community needs with a member of the state or city government, such as a representative from the parks and recreation department. Certain environmental volunteer opportunities are regional, such as coastal cleanup initiatives. Animal and environmental-based charities enjoyed a surge in 2023, with participation rates climbing by more than 7 percent.



Finally, individuals can volunteer with an organization that supports the development of local youth, such as a youth sports league or tutoring group. Nearly 71 million youth athletes took part in team sports in 2023, not to mention popular individual sports like tennis and golf. Youth sports leagues rely on a wide range of volunteers, from food servers to coaches. Meanwhile, tutors help an estimated 15 percent of American students. Thereâ€™s a dire need for capable tutors, as less than 2 percent of students receive high-quality tutoring services.
